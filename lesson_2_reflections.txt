What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
R/I create a new folder called .git That folder is empty at first because git doesn't create a first commitby itself
instead i have tocreate the first commit. Anotherthng to remember, that folder is invisible to the user (because it
has a dot at the beggining).
I have to initialize a repositorybecause is there where all the history of my files will be stocked

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
R/the staging area is an intermediate place, like a neutral place but from were i can go a commit, i'm halfway from
the commit. The value it offers is that i can choose wich file i want to make a commit on and i don't do the commit
directly but i go to lika a working room with my file and then if i really decide to commit i can do it

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I think i should always use the remote and the local repository, it will be safer, bacause if something happens
to my device i can still find my files in the remoe repository. Another reason is that if i want to work with 
other people with a remote repository we'll all hace access to the entiry history of the project we're working on

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
 remote repository?
I'm not sure of the reason,may be because manually i can choose the branch were i want to put it or because i need
to continue making some modifications on my local repository as it was, so without the possible changes that have
been made on the remote 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone is used to copy a repository from GitHub to my computer, or to make a copy of a repository locally on my computer.
Fork is similar to Clone but is used to make a copy of a repository from GitHub to GitHub. Branches are different paths
that i can find inside a repository, locally or on GitHub.
